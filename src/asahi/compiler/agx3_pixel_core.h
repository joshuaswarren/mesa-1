 * AGX3 pixel writeout barriers: wait_pix -> pixwait and signal_pix -> pixrel.
 *
 * Every Apple fragment shader brackets its tile traffic with these two:
 *
 *   pixwait(gate) ... [movmsk] ... lstcol x (RT x sample) ... pixrel(release)
 *
 * Both carry a writeout-class mask that is the same bitmask AGX2 spells as the
 * wait_pix / signal_pix `writeout` immediate -- 1 for the depth/coverage class,
 * 4/8/12 for the colour classes -- so the IR immediate passes straight through.
 * Only the masks Apple's own compiler emitted are accepted; anything else fails
 * closed rather than guessing a class the hardware may interpret differently.
 *
 * Composer-driven; reproduces Apple's witnessed G15G/G16G/G17S bytes exactly.
