 * AGX3 `copy` -- the register-file move.
 *
 * AGX3 operands carry a kind selector: 1 = immediate, 2 = register, 3 =
 * uniform, with the operand value deposited in a different field per kind
 * (slot A: f15 immediate / f16 register / f17 uniform; slot B: f31 register /
 * f32 uniform).  That mapping is not a guess: it is read straight off Apple's
 * own instructions, where `lddev` selects a uniform base with f38 = 3 + f32,
 * `iadd` adds a uniform with f38 = 3 + f32, and 49 of the 100 G16G `copy`
 * instructions move a uniform into a register with f23 = 3 + f17.
 *
 * A uniform therefore reaches a GPR on AGX3 exactly the way Apple's compiler
 * puts it there: one 4-byte `copy` (ep0), 32-bit, no wait bits.  Mesa's
 * agx_lower_uniform_sources() already materializes such a move for every
 * generic-ALU uniform source on AGX3; without this encoder that move lowers
 * to a `bitop` whose source is still a uniform, which the packer refuses --
 * so every shader that reads a pushed uniform in an ALU op fails to compile.
 *
 * Only the witnessed form is encoded.  Everything else (16- and 64-bit
 * widths, modifiers, wait masks, the register-source `copy`) fails closed.
