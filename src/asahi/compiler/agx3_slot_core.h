 * AGX3 scoreboard slot assignment.
 *
 * AGX3 has no standalone wait instruction and no AGX2-style two-slot scoreboard.
 * Instead every async result (device/threadgroup load, texture sample, atomic,
 * stack fill) is tagged with a scoreboard slot, and every later instruction that
 * consumes such a result carries a wait-bit mask naming the slots it must first
 * synchronise. A slot waited once is satisfied for all later instructions until
 * it is reallocated ("waited once = satisfied globally"). ALU-to-ALU
 * dependencies are hardware-interlocked and need no wait.
 *
 * This is the encoding-independent algorithm -- which async op gets which slot,
 * and which slots each instruction waits -- expressed over a normalized
 * instruction list so it is testable on its own. The wait-bit field ids per
 * mnemonic (agx3_wait_field_map) and the actual deposit are the caller's.
