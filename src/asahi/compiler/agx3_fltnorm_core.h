 * The two AGX3 fragment colour-path instructions Mesa had no producer for:
 * `fltnorm` (float -> normalized lane pack) and `f32mul.ep4` (the perspective
 * divide).
 *
 * Both appear in *every* Apple fragment shader in the G17P corpus, which is
 * why they rank ahead of discard and depth: a fragment shader that writes a
 * normalized render target cannot be assembled without `fltnorm`, and one that
 * reads a perspective-correct varying cannot be assembled the way Apple does
 * without `f32mul.ep4`.
 *
 * ## fltnorm
 *
 * `fltnorm` takes two 32-bit floats and packs them, normalized, into the two
 * halves of one 16-bit register; `lstcol` then stores those 16-bit registers.
 * A four-component 8-bit target therefore costs exactly two `fltnorm`s, which
 * is what every witness shows.
 *
 * Operand model, PROVEN by construction against 19 witnesses (7 from the
 * shipped .metalar objects fmain / fdiscard / ftex / fdepth, 12 from offline
 * `applegpu-nt -arch applegpu_g17p` probes that vary component count, target
 * format, swizzle, attachment count and operand class):
 *
 *   f9  = 2, f2 = destination 16-bit register, f10 = 1 (16-bit)
 *   f23 = source-0 class: 1 immediate (AGX minifloat in f15),
 *                         2 register (f16), 3 uniform (f17); f24 = 2, 32-bit
 *   f40 = source-1 class, same encoding, value in f32 / f33 / f34; f41 = 2
 *   f25 / f27  = source-0 liveness pair, only for a register source:
 *                f27 = 1 last use, f25 = 1 still live
 *   f42 / f44  = the same pair for source 1
 *   f28 / f29  = source-0 abs / neg of a register source, f45 / f46 for
 *                source 1: abs(x) and -x into R8/RG8/RGBA8Unorm, R16Unorm,
 *                RG16Snorm and R8Snorm set them, -abs(x) sets both
 *                (blend/native/negpack.py, negpack2.py)
 *   f58 = normalized format: U8=0, S8=1, U16=2, S16=3, and the two sRGB
 *         modes below. Fresh native R16Unorm/R16Snorm pipelines establish the
 *         upper width bit.
 *   f59 = 1 two packed lanes. A single-component target instead sets f59 = 0,
 *         f40 = 0, f41 = 1 and has no second source (probe fn_r).
 *   f50 + (slot - 1) = the per-slot wait mask, as in every other AGX3b form.
 *
 * The minifloat encoding of an immediate source is Apple's usual one: 0.25 is
 * 16, 0.5 is 32, 0.75 is 40, 1.0 is 48 (probe fn_const, whose two instructions
 * carry exactly those four values).
 *
 * f68 is set when FLTNORM starts the main program, for both immediate and
 * uniform operands. It is clear after pixel operations or position arithmetic,
 * including when that later FLTNORM is the first uniform reader. Model only
 * this native instruction-position rule; the hardware meaning is not named.
 *
 * ## f32mul.ep4/ep5
 *
 * AGX3 has no fused projective iterator, so a perspective-correct varying is
 * `f32interp` of the raw value, `f32rcp` of the interpolated 1/W, and a
 * multiply. Apple spells that multiply with encoding point 4 rather than the
 * ordinary `f32mul.ep1` it uses for user multiplies -- probe fn_mul2, which
 * contains both in one shader, separates them cleanly.
 *
 * ep4 carries one extra base field, f70, and across all 20 witnesses in six
 * shaders f70 equals the varying index (`f22`) of the `f32interp` that
 * produced the multiply's raw operand -- including probe fn_swz, where the
 * shader's component order is reversed and f70 follows the varying rather than
 * the program order. INFERRED, on that correlation: f70 names the attribute
 * the divide belongs to. Nothing else about ep4 differs from ep1.
 *
 *   f9 = 2 / f2 general destination (with hint f11), or f9 = 5 / f5 staging
 *          destination on slot f12 -- ftex divides straight into the texture
 *          coordinate staging registers
 *   f35 = the reciprocal operand (f42 = 2 register, f43 = 2 32-bit), liveness
 *         pair f46 last use / f44 still live
 *   f18 = the interpolated operand (f25 = 2, f26 = 2), liveness pair
 *         f29 last use / f27 still live
 *   f80 + (slot - 1) = wait mask
 *
 * The compact ep4 form can name staging slots 1..5. Apple's dynamic argument-
 * buffer fragment path stages coordinates on slot 6 and uses the otherwise
 * identical extended ep5 form; its extra bytes carry that upper slot bit.
 *
 * ## The sRGB conversion modes
 *
 * f58 (and normflt's f40, which is the same field on the other side) reaches
 * two further values, and they are what makes an sRGB attachment free. From
 * nine fresh render pipelines built with `metal-nt -arch applegpu_g17p` and
 * rebuilt against `applegpu_g17s`:
 *
 *   f58 = 4   every lane of this pack is sRGB-encoded
 *   f58 = 6   lane 0 is sRGB-encoded, lane 1 is a linear UNORM8 lane
 *
 * A float4 into RGBA8Unorm_sRGB is therefore mode 4 on the (R,G) pack and
 * mode 6 on the (B,A) pack, because the alpha channel of an sRGB format is
 * linear. BGRA8Unorm_sRGB emits byte-identical code, so channel order is not
 * the shader's business. R8Unorm_sRGB is one lane at mode 4 and RG8Unorm_sRGB
 * two lanes at mode 4, so the mode describes the lanes rather than the
 * attachment. Fixed-function blending on an sRGB attachment adds no
 * instruction at all, and a shader with an sRGB attachment at color(0) and a
 * linear one at color(1) selects per attachment. Programmable blending shows
 * the same two modes on the `normflt` decode. f58 = 5 is unwitnessed.
 *
 * The whole difference between Apple's sRGB and linear RGBA8 fragment programs
 * is these two field values: the `lstcol` that follows is byte-identical,
 * which is the same statement as "lstcol carries a width, not a format".
 *
 * ## normflt
 *
 * The inverse, for a tilebuffer *read* of a normalized 8-bit attachment: one
 * 16-bit register in, two 32-bit floats out. Same story as the store side --
 * `lldcol` carries a width, not a format, so the unpack is explicit. Witnessed
 * by three programmable-blending probes (`float4/float2/float [[color(0)]]`)
 * on both encodings.
 *
 *   f9 = 2, f2 = the 32-bit destination pair, f10 = 2
 *   f18 = the 16-bit source, f25 = 2 register, f26 = 1 (16-bit)
 *   f41 = 1 two lanes, 0 one lane -- the same role f59 plays for fltnorm
 *   f32 + (slot - 1) = the per-slot wait mask. PROVEN: the tile load these
 *       consume publishes on slot 6 (AGX3b) or 8 (AGX3c), and exactly the
 *       corresponding bit is set on the first unpack of each pair.
 *
 * ## AGX3c
 *
 * Every operand field id is identical on AGX3c; the encoding differs only by
 * the sub-opcode constants it carries -- f48 = 3, f49 = 72 for `fltnorm`, and
 * f30 = 3, f31 = 115 for `normflt`. That was established by re-running the
 * same probe set against `applegpu_g17s`, which is the AGX3c part.
