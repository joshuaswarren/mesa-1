/*
 * Witnessed (SR number, width) pairs: one Apple-compiled kernel per MSL
 * builtin, identical numbers on agx3b and
 * agx3c. 16-bit: 6 simdgroup_index_in_threadgroup, 7 thread_index_in_simdgroup,
 * 9/10/11 thread_position_in_threadgroup.xyz, 13 thread_index_in_threadgroup,
 * 17/18/19 threads_per_threadgroup.xyz, 20/21/22
 * dispatch_threads_per_threadgroup.xyz, 34 active thread index in the
 * subgroup, 36 (witnessed in Apple device-atomic kernels, attribution
 * UNKNOWN). 32-bit: 23/24/25 thread_position_in_grid.xyz,
 * 26/27/28 threadgroup_position_in_grid.xyz.
 *
 * Two 32-bit numbers are hardware-vertex invocation inputs. The composer's
 * anonymous f21 values 51 and 46 encode hardware SR bytes 0xdd vertex ID and
 * 0xd8 instance ID respectively. They are isolated by otherwise identical
 * G17P vertex shaders and compile to `0cdd1006` / `0cd81006` for destination
 * r0.
 *
 * Three more feed the post-tessellation vertex program of a Metal
 * tessellation pipeline, between those two: 47 (byte 0xd9) is [[patch_id]],
 * and 48 and 49 (0xda, 0xdb) are the two [[position_in_patch]] coordinates as
 * 32-bit floats, for triangle and quad patches alike (a triangle's third
 * barycentric is computed as 1 - u - v). metal-nt -arch applegpu_g17p reads
 * them as `0cd91006`, `2cda1046` and `1cdb1066`.
 *
 * Three more 16-bit numbers are fragment-only (`metal-nt -arch
 * applegpu_g17p`):
 *
 *  - 39 is the *incoming* coverage word. PROVEN: a fragment shader that reads
 *    `uint m [[sample_mask]]` compiles to exactly `rld h0 <- SR 39 (W16)`,
 *    `h0 >>= 4`, `int2flt`, so the incoming mask sits in bits 4..7.
 *  - 2 is read by every 1x fragment shader that writes a sample mask or a
 *    depth and by no colour-only shader; its value is combined into the staged
 *    coverage word as N | (T << 4) | (T << 8). Reproducing Apple's own
 *    kill-all constant from that formula requires T = 0xF0, i.e. a four-bit
 *    mask in bits 4..7 exactly like SR 39. Presence and use are PROVEN;
 *    "the per-invocation target-sample mask" is INFERRED from that arithmetic.
 *  - 41 is the back-facing predicate. A `[[front_facing]] ? 17 : 3` fragment
 *    reads SR41 and selects 17 when that value equals zero, directly pinning
 *    both the register identity and its polarity.
 *
 * SR 34 is the active thread index in the subgroup. Apple's G17P compiler reads
 * it for simd_is_first() in compute, vertex and fragment shaders as
 * `rld SR34 == 0`, and compiles simd_broadcast_first(x) to
 * `simdiballot(SR34 == 0)`, find-first-set, `simdbcast`. A fragment read
 * whose result only reaches the colour output also sets f48; the same read
 * feeding a derivative or a quad reduction, or inside a helper-invocation
 * guard, leaves it clear (agx3_sr_desc::fragment_active_index).
