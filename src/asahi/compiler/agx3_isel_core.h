 * AGX3 `isel` -- the fused integer compare-and-select.
 *
 * AGX3 keeps AGX2's fused compare-select: one instruction compares two
 * registers under a condition and returns one of two further operands. That
 * is Mesa's AGX_OPCODE_ICMPSEL exactly, which matters because
 * agx_lower_pseudo() turns *every* AGX_OPCODE_ICMP into an icmpsel -- without
 * this encoder no shader containing any integer comparison can be compiled.
 *
 * Everything here is probe-witnessed, not inferred. A ladder of 12 MSL
 * kernels differing only in the comparison operator was compiled by Apple's
 * own offline translator (`metal-nt -arch applegpu_g16g`, the AGX3b encoding
 * G17P uses) and decoded through Apple's own encoder tables. The condition
 * field f106 tracked the operator one-for-one and turned out to be numbered
 * exactly like `enum agx_icond`:
 *
 *     ult = 1   ugt = 2   eq = 4   slt = 5   sgt = 6
 *
 * which is the same numbering agx3_cf_core.c already carries for `icmp`'s
 * f42. There is no le/ge/ne condition and no invert bit: Apple emits the
 * inverse condition with the two selected operands swapped, which is also how
 * Mesa spells them, so no translation is needed. Condition 3 is witnessed in
 * Apple's corpus with unknown meaning and is refused here, as in the CF core.
 *
 * Each selected operand is independently a register or an 8-bit immediate,
 * and the two kinds use different value fields, which the probes pin
 * separately:
 *
 *   both registers   ep27  kind 3, values f66 / f83
 *   both immediates  ep27  kind 1, values f64 / f81   (ep25 when 16-bit)
 *   register + imm   ep27  kind 2 register in f65, immediate in f81
 *   imm + register   ep27  kind 1 immediate in f64, register in f82
 *
 * The mixed register fields f65/f82 were pinned by a kernel containing two
 * such selects over different registers: only those fields tracked the two
 * register numbers. Every shape below reproduces its witnessed instruction
 * byte-for-byte. Both widths support all four selected-operand shapes.
 *
 * Scoreboard waits ride on fields f98..f103, one per slot 1..6. That is
 * probe-derived at both ends: a select consuming a load that signalled slot 6
 * sets f103, and one consuming a load that signalled slot 1 sets f98.
 *
 * The production explicit-hint form uses kind-2 register operands and actual
 * post-RA cache/discard bits. Fresh G17P uint/ushort dead/live witnesses pin
 * comparator fields f44/f46 and f59/f61, and selection fields f74/f76 and
 * f91/f93. Native 16-bit signed comparisons/equality carry f47/f62 on register
 * comparands, matching the signed short and unsigned equality witnesses.
 * A right-hand u8 immediate uses f49/kind1; the packer reverses comparisons
 * with an immediate on the left. Signed/unsigned 16-bit and u8-comparand forms stay
 * fused, without temporary register materialization.
 *
 * f12 is destination cache. A fresh direct-store/continued-use pair changes
 * only destination register allocation and f12; the continued-use form sets
 * it for a 16-bit boolean result even though both selected values are
 * immediates. The compact native wait selector represents one slot or slots1+2;
 * other producer combinations must be retired separately before this form.
