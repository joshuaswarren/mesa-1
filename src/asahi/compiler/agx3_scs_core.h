 * AGX3 scalar SCS load/store encoders and decoders.
 *
 * The supported address-space(5) forms were recovered with controlled Apple
 * G17P/G17S compiler probes.  Four address kinds are represented, spanning
 * every combination Apple's G17P ray-query setup emits: direct-absolute, a
 * scalar register index plus a uniform-register base, a scalar register index
 * plus a register base, and a register base with no index -- each with a
 * signed 16-bit byte displacement.  Loads and stores may move one through four
 * 32-bit components.
 *
 * AGX3c supports W32 vectors and direct, uniform-indexed, and register-base
 * addressing witnessed in Apple's ray setup. Its destination-less traversal
 * epilogue has a separate descriptor and API below.
