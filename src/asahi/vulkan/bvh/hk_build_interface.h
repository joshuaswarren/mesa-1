/* Native refits (updates).
 *
 * A full build that allows updates keeps its encoding jobs after the image,
 * at the retained offset: an hk_agx3_retained_state, one hk_agx3_retained_job
 * per job, then the IR offsets of the children of every leaf job,
 * concatenated. An update keeps the topology: it regenerates the IR leaves
 * and re-encodes each leaf job from them, then each inner job from its
 * children's bounds: refit encoding (agx3_leaf.comp built with
 * HK_AGX3_REFIT) encodes the leaf jobs, then agx3_refit.comp the inner
 * jobs. It reads neither IR internal nodes nor a plan.
 *
 * A child job hands its bounds to its parent at its position: the parent's
 * first position plus the child's index. Positions number the children of
 * all inner jobs, so they run to job_count - 2; the root's is job_count - 1.
 *
 * Inner jobs have levels, a third of the binary depth of the job's IR node:
 * an inner job's inner children are one level deeper. After the child
 * offsets (room for every leaf) come the inner jobs of the first
 * HK_AGX3_REFIT_LEVELS levels by level: a count and a fill cursor per
 * level, then the jobs of level 0, of level 1, and so on. An update encodes
 * those a level per dispatch, deepest first, with no arrivals; refit
 * propagation encodes any deeper ones.
 *
 * Last come the slots of the leaves of a triangle structure: for each IR
 * leaf, the index of its child offset, or ~0 for a leaf in no leaf job. A
 * triangle update may skip generating IR leaves: its leaf pass leaves each
 * triangle (hk_agx3_refit_triangle) at its slot, so that each leaf job
 * finds its children together.
