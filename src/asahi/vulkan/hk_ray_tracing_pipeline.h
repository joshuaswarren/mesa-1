 * VK_KHR_ray_tracing_pipeline for Honeykrisp on G17P.
 *
 * The whole pipeline compiles to ONE compute shader.  Every stage the
 * application supplies is inlined into it as a NIR function, traceRayEXT
 * becomes an inlined copy of the software traversal that VK_KHR_ray_query
 * already uses, and the shader binding table selects between the inlined
 * copies with a comparison on the group index.  There is no indirect shader
 * call, no resume shader and no shader-call stack: recursion is bounded by
 * maxPipelineRayRecursionDepth at compile time and unrolled.
 *
 * This is the shape lavapipe uses, and it is used here for the same reason:
 * the AGX3 backend has no way to branch to an address the command stream
 * supplies, so a real shader-binding-table dispatch is not expressible today.
 * docs/G17P_RAYTRACING_PIPELINE_ABI.md records what that costs and what would
 * have to be grounded to change it.
