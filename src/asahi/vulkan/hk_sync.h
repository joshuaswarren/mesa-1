 * Recorded-dependency tracking for Honeykrisp control streams.
 *
 * A command buffer is a list of control streams, each submitted as one
 * render (VDM) or compute (CDM) command. The kernel orders commands through
 * two per-command fields, vdm_barrier and cdm_barrier, each naming a prefix
 * of the respective subqueue that must complete before the command runs
 * (include/drm-uapi/asahi_drm.h, drm_asahi_cmd_header). The value NONE means
 * the command waits on nothing on that subqueue, not even earlier submits.
 *
 * Vulkan orders work through explicit dependencies: pipeline barriers,
 * events, subpass dependencies (which the common render-pass code lowers to
 * pipeline barriers) and semaphores. Every one of them is prefix-shaped: the
 * first synchronization scope of vkCmdPipelineBarrier2 is "all commands
 * earlier in submission order" restricted to the source stages, and the
 * second is "all commands later in submission order" restricted to the
 * destination stages (Vulkan 1.3, 7.6 "Pipeline Barriers"). The kernel's
 * prefix encoding therefore loses nothing against the barrier model on one
 * queue; what it cannot express is stage granularity (a barrier from vertex
 * work into fragment work still waits on and gates whole commands), and it
 * cannot distinguish two commands in the same prefix. Both would need UAPI
 * extensions.
 *
 * This module records, per stream, the latest earlier stream on each
 * subqueue that a recorded dependency orders it after ("cut"), plus which
 * kinds of pre-command-buffer work it must wait on ("prior"). Kinds
 * approximate the Vulkan stage classes at the granularity the hardware has:
 * graphics, compute and transfer. Streams the driver adds on its own
 * (queries, timestamps, events, heap management) carry the implicit orderings
 * Vulkan requires of them; a stream a meta operation records inherits the
 * application dependency it stands in for because it is created under the
 * same recorded state.
 *
 * At submission the cuts become exact prefix indices, cross-command-buffer
 * dependencies are resolved against the other command buffers in the same
 * submission. With EXACT_PRIOR_BARRIERS, dependencies reaching before this
 * submission name exact queue-local hardware ordinals; destination requirements
 * persist across submissions. Older kernels retain the "all earlier submits"
 * representation and existing per-submit requirement lifetime.
