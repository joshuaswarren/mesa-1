 * Apple GPU identity, instruction-set generation and binary encoding.

 * These are three different questions and the driver has historically only
 * asked the first one, because every part it supported answered the other two
 * the same way. That stops being true at M3:
 *
 *   - G13 (M1) and G14 (M2) are the AGX2 instruction set. That is what
 *     agx_pack.c emits and what src/asahi/isa/AGX2.xml describes.
 *   - G15 (M3), G16 (M4) and G17 (M5) are AGX3, a different instruction set.
 *     Apple's own compiler routes them through a separate LLVM target, and
 *     the community AGX2 decoder consumes 0% of their code.
 *   - AGX3 is not one encoding. Two binary encodings exist, and which one a
 *     part uses is now known for every chip this driver can enumerate.
 *
 * AGX3 now has separate decoders and encoders. Device support remains a
 * stricter question: G17P is admitted only through its exact T8140 contract,
 * while other AGX3 identities stay outside the runnable Honeykrisp path until
 * their independently-versioned pieces are connected.
