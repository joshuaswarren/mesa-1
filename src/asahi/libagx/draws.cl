 * `templates` holds, per kernel, the 11 words the host encoded for that
 * kernel: the 40-byte direct launch (sizes are overwritten here) and its
 * trailing barrier. `slot` is {0x60000000, launch[10], barrier, return}; the
 * host wrote words 0 and 12. With no matching kernel the launch keeps kernel
 * 0's header with every size zero, the encoding Metal uses for an empty
 * command. `out_groups` still receives the VkDispatchIndirectCommand the
 * kernels' root descriptor points at.
